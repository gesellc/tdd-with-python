# Test-Driven Development with Python

In this repository I will work through Harry J.W. Percival's book "Test-Driven Development with Python".

Go and visit the book's home planet: http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/

## Play with the app locally

* Check prerequisites (you might only need Django for now)

  http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/pre-requisite-installations.html#_required_software_installations

* Start Server

        python3 manage.py runserver

* Point your favourite browser to home

## Useful Commands

* Running the Django dev server

        python3 manage.py runserver

* Running the functional tests

        python3 functional_tests.py

* Running the unit tests

        python3 manage.py test

This is a test
