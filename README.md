# Test-Driven Development with Python

In this repository I will work through Harry J.W. Percival's book "Test-Driven Development with Python".

The book's home planet is here: http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/

## Useful Commands and Concepts

* Running the Django dev server

        python3 manage.py runserver

* Running the functional tests

        python3 functional_tests.py

* Running the unit tests

        python3 manage.py test

## The unit-test/code cycle

1. Run the unit tests in the terminal.
2. Make a minimal code change in the editor.
3. Repeat!
